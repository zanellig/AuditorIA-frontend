# Refine Canvas Reference Handling in ConfettiComponent

## Description

The current implementation of the canvas callback performs an early return with the following condition:

```javascript
if (instanceRef.current) return;
```

This early exit may prevent a new confetti instance from being created when the canvas element is replaced. Such behavior can lead to potential remount issues where the existing instance remains stale and hinders proper reinitialization. In a dynamic UI scenario, where the canvas might be reattached, this implementation detail could cause unexpected behavior.

## Suggested Commit Changes

Replace the early return with a block that resets the existing instance and clears the reference. The proposed diff is:

```diff
- if (instanceRef.current) return;
+ if (instanceRef.current) {
+   instanceRef.current.reset();
+   instanceRef.current = null;
+ }
```

## Testing Instructions

To verify that this change works as intended:

- **Simulate a Canvas Reattachment:** Manually or through automated tests, simulate the scenario where the canvas element is removed and then reattached to the DOM.
- **Verify Instance Reset:** Ensure that upon reattachment, the previous confetti instance is properly reset and cleared.
- **Confirm New Instance Creation:** After the canvas is reattached, verify that a new confetti instance is successfully created and initialized.

## Impact and Considerations

- **Edge-Case Improvement:** This change is a non-critical ("nice to have") improvement aimed at handling an edge-case scenario rather than optimizing performance.
- **Resource Management:** By resetting the old instance and clearing the reference, the updated approach helps prevent potential memory leaks and ensures that the component remains responsive to dynamic changes.

Please review this change in the broader context of the application's lifecycle management and confirm that it aligns with our approach to handling component remount scenarios.
